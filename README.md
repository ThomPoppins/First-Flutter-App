# First Flutter App

My first Flutter application. Build by following [this tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0) from Google Codelabs.

## Why **Flutter** and not **React Native**?

1. Performance: Flutter uses Dart, a compiled language, which allows it to achieve high performance and fast startup times. React Native, on the other hand, uses JavaScript, which can be slower.

2. Hot Reload: Flutter's hot reload feature allows developers to see changes in the app's UI in real-time, without having to restart the app. React Native also has a hot reload feature, but it can be slower and less reliable.

3. Customizable Widgets: Flutter provides a rich set of customizable widgets that can be used to build beautiful and responsive UIs. React Native, on the other hand, relies on native components, which can be less customizable.

4. Development Time: Flutter's fast development cycle, combined with its hot reload feature, can significantly reduce development time. React Native can also be fast, but it may require more setup and configuration.

5. Single Codebase: Flutter allows developers to build apps for both iOS and Android using a single codebase, which can save time and reduce complexity. React Native also allows for cross-platform development, but it may require more platform-specific code.

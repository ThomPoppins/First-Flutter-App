# First Flutter App

My first Flutter application. Build by following [this tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0) from Google Codelabs.

**Personal note**: According to Google, Flutter is inspired by the functional programming (kind of) way of building up the UI from components inside components. In Flutter this would be Widgets inside of Widgets. This is a interesting approach for me to work with because I already am very much used to the React way of building the component and passing state data from parent to child and this way of building up the complete UI is easily to adopt in Flutter. 

The only thing I need to learn is all Flutter syntax and learn all possible widgets to use to get my mobile application up-to-date with the MERN stack web application for the browser found in my MERN_STACK_PROJ. repository. I want all functionalities implemented in MERN_STACK_PROJ. also in a Flutter application so the user can also use it's Android or Iphone to login and edit/register companies (and much more later) and I want the Flutter app to work with the same database as the web application so the phone app will always be in sync with the web app.

## Why **Flutter** and not **React Native**?

1. Performance: Flutter uses Dart, a compiled language, which allows it to achieve high performance and fast startup times. React Native, on the other hand, uses JavaScript, which can be slower.

2. Hot Reload: Flutter's hot reload feature allows developers to see changes in the app's UI in real-time, without having to restart the app. React Native also has a hot reload feature, but it can be slower and less reliable.

3. Customizable Widgets: Flutter provides a rich set of customizable widgets that can be used to build beautiful and responsive UIs. React Native, on the other hand, relies on native components, which can be less customizable.

4. Development Time: Flutter's fast development cycle, combined with its hot reload feature, can significantly reduce development time. React Native can also be fast, but it may require more setup and configuration.

5. Single Codebase: Flutter allows developers to build apps for both iOS and Android using a single codebase, which can save time and reduce complexity. React Native also allows for cross-platform development, but it may require more platform-specific code.
